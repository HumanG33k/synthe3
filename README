Compiling under Linux
=====================

Just run make

This will produce a shared library (libsynthe3.so) and a test executable
(synthe3).

To run the program from its sources, first do:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`

so that synthe3 can find the shared library.

Compiling under Windows
=======================

Download Microsoft Windows SDK from Microsoft's web site:
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279

Then install it and copy the DSound.lib file from
Progam Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\V7.1\Lib\
to the directory containing this README file.
Then follow the standard installation procedure described above.
